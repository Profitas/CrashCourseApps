Sometimes the only thing that&rsquo;s left to do is to tear at your hair and scream in frustration!</p> <p>This app, however, is a tool you can use to demystify the inner workings of the male psyche. I promise that in&nbsp;this app, you will find immediately applicable strategies and tactics you can use to snatch the man of your dreams back into your life.</p><p>I also promise that this app will be a great alternative to ripping your hair out.&nbsp;This app is divided into different strategies you can use immediately to get your man interested in you again.&nbsp;The insights come from years of experience that I&rsquo;ve had as a professional dating coach, and from hundreds of real-world interviews conducted with some of the most devious (but ethical!) female seducers in the world. </p><p>You will gain a lot more than a few simple techniques, though.&nbsp;The content discussed here will also teach you the newest and most interesting techniques, that I haven&rsquo;t ever revealed before to the public, in not only getting your man back, but keeping him perpetually interested in you, and fascinated by your new-found appealing feminine aura. </p><p>My motivation for becoming a professional dating coach, and for deciding to share my knowledge within this app came from an altruistic desire to truly help the women involved in failing relationships everywhere in the western world.</p><p>Approximately 60% of marriages in America end in divorce, which is a telling sign of the underlying relationship problems that pervade our country.&nbsp;I made it my mission to discover exactly what was causing such astronomical divorce rates, and then focus on how I can help women everywhere learn to revitalize their dying relationships.</p><p>I had a desire to understand the precise human psychological mechanisms that result in a couple living in a fulfilling, lasting, and loving relationship. </p><p>As of this writing, I&rsquo;ve been teaching women everywhere how to work on bettering their relationships, and renewing seemingly lost ones, for the better part of eight years.</p><p>Over my time both in the field, and in real-life situations helping women get the man of their dreams back, and in the laboratory, scavenging the most recent and pertinent human psychology studies published by the most prestigious universities, I began to see the underlying pattern that exists within each relationship.</p><p>You see, while each individual person may be unique in their own desires, characteristics, and personalities, the larger part of a relationship hinges on predefined social norms that exist outside of a person&rsquo;s uniqueness.&nbsp;Reflecting on my years of experience, I&rsquo;ve realized that these underlying relationship patterns come together to form common, but frequently misunderstood or hidden, trends and patterns.&nbsp;I saw things that couples did that lead to an eventual breakup.&nbsp;I saw things that couples did that helped them add new breath to a stale relationship.&nbsp;And, most importantly, I saw things that you (the woman) can do to ensure that your man will never leave you or look at another female again.</p><p>I had, in essence, successfully cracked the dating code.&nbsp;This app will unveil the patterns I&rsquo;ve discovered, as well as show you cutting-edge techniques that you can use today to take advantage of these patterns.&nbsp;The dynamics between a male and a female have always been of great interest to me.&nbsp;I talk, read, and learn about it as often as I can, to anybody who will listen.&nbsp;What I&rsquo;ve uncovered in my time in this field is nothing short of amazing.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page"

--><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>An Introduction to Relationship Dynamics</h1><p>Before I can teach you the practical tools and tactics needed to get your boyfriend back, I need to outline some of the core reasoning behind it.&nbsp;This reasoning converges into a set of core principles that are irrefutably present in every male-female relationship that has ever occurred. </p><p>An understanding of these principles, in turn, allows you to better, and more intuitively understand precisely how the techniques I&rsquo;m going to lay out in latter sections function.&nbsp;These principles are based on the underlying differences in psychology inherent to males and females, and are built upon the countless hours I&rsquo;ve spent reading the latest psychological journals for cutting-edge, scientific, and highly practical research.</p><p>The first key principle to understand is that men and women are wired differently from one another. This one requires little explanation.&nbsp;While there are obviously some similarities between the two sexes, there is a gulf of differences in terms of how their brains function when it comes to understanding and forming relationships.&nbsp;Even the desired outcomes from a relationship differ greatly between males and females. As well, there are huge differences in the things that either sex finds attractive – and these function on a deep, psychological level.</p><p>In relationship science, the first difference that becomes clear is the role that men and women play in the courtship rituals. Traditionally, men have been the ones who initiate contact, begin making advances, and work hard to get the female&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp;On the other hand, women have played the role of the selector in such relations. They get to choose which of the multiple males making advances they want, and can thus be more picky, more selective, in the men they chose to begin relationships with.</p><p>This principle has been hard-wired in the brains of both males and females by evolutionary science, and works completely to the advantage of the female.&nbsp;The woman had the freedom to choose the best looking, most intelligent, and most caring partner for her to begin a relationship with.</p><p>Our brains are deeply rooted to facilitating these roles.&nbsp;The only problem, for women, is that the huge advantage they traditionally gain at the start of a relationship begins to deteriorate as the courtship progresses.&nbsp;In many cases that I have seen, at a certain point in the relationship, the roles become completely reversed.&nbsp;The woman then finds herself pursuing the same man who was vying for her attention only weeks ago, and the grip of power goes completely back to the man.</p><p>Typically the trajectory is as follows. A man begins his pursuit of a woman, and the woman is both flattered and interested.&nbsp;She shows some initial restraint, but is soon won over by the man&rsquo;s advances.&nbsp;The man, sensing this, takes advantage of the opportunity and begins making more aggressive moves on the advances.&nbsp;He takes her out, wines and dines her, and eventually goes to bed with her.</p><p>By this point, the woman feels comfortable in the man&rsquo;s presence, and starts to want to win even more of her man&rsquo;s approval.&nbsp;She begins to dress sexier, pretends to be interested in his hobbies, and frees up her schedule to spend more time with him.&nbsp;This is exactly the point where the tables turn.</p><p>The man is no longer pursuing;he has, in effect, won over the woman.&nbsp;Now, it is up to her to keep him interested, and she does so by trying to please him, either by the way she looks, or the things she does with him, or some other variation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Think back, and try to remember a situation where you found yourself seeking your man&rsquo;s approval.</p><p>This is the point where something about the female selector role changes.&nbsp;Originally, it was your ex-boyfriend who displayed interest in you, who pursued you, who chased you.&nbsp;Ultimately, you were the one to select him.&nbsp;Your desire for a relationship with him became overpowering, and you valued the promise of a long, healthy relationship more than the selection of the best possible man on your terms.</p><p>So, little by little, you began to try to foster a deeper relationship with him. You feigned interest in his activities, dressed yourself up to look good for him, catered to his wishes.&nbsp;However, at a certain point, such subservient behavior becomes unappealing to a man.&nbsp;This spirals out of control, and you lose the grip you had on your once-solid relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>To regain control of a relationship, you have to clearly establish that you are the selector and he is pursuing you.&nbsp;You need to consistently work to reaffirm your feminine role of power in the relationship, because he is the one chasing you.&nbsp;You have to test him over and over to make sure he is a good fit for a long-term relationship. </p><p><em>&quot;Those who care least, control the power dynamic in a relationship.&quot;</em></p><p>Remember that quote. Right now, you are the one who cares most, else you would not be reading this.</p><p>Although we have to accept that you can&rsquo;t simply turn off the powerful emotions you have for your ex-boyfriend, there are definitive actions you can take to make it seem as if you care less.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s too bad emotions never quite work the way you want them too.</p><p>However, we can use certain rules of relationship dynamics to re-establish your role as selector.&nbsp;These immediate tools will be used to drive your man insane with jealously and desire for you all over again.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page2" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page4" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page4" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page3" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page5" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>Never Ever Make Yourself Be Only The &lsquo;Casual Girl&rsquo;To The Man You Value.</h1><p>The first rule of re-establishing control is to never, ever make yourself out to be the &ldquo;casual girl&rdquo;for the man you value.&nbsp;This is as much to your benefit as it is to his.&nbsp;A truth about men is that they enjoy keeping around girls to keep as &ldquo;casual&rdquo;friends.&nbsp;These girls require no commitment, don&rsquo;t ask for anything in return, and are very low-maintenance, all traits highly important to a man.</p><p>However, the only purpose that they serve, from the man&rsquo;s perspective, is to reaffirm his position of power.&nbsp;By keeping such girls on call, men benefit from the ego boost they get whenever one of them &ldquo;comes over&rdquo;to his place.&nbsp;He can brag to his friends about them, and gain status and social power in his social circle by being moulding his persona as that of a &ldquo;player.&rdquo;</p><p>What&rsquo;s to stop the man, then, from trying to convert you into a &ldquo;casual girl&rdquo;?&nbsp;The answer, from my personal experience and research, is that men innately also desire a strong, girlfriend material type of girl.&nbsp;Social conventions force them to try to accumulate the number of &ldquo;casual girls&rdquo;they know, but an entirely different set of emotions and reasoning overcomes to them when they come across a valuable girl who they see as girlfriend material.</p><p>The conflict of these two desires lies at the heart of many broken relationships.&nbsp;This works kind of in the same way with women.&nbsp;Women typically have men who they call &ldquo;just friends&rdquo;, and who they would never consider sleeping with.&nbsp;Women also have men who they know and would sleep with in a heartbeat.&nbsp;These two disparate types of relationships are extremely common amongst both males and females.</p><p>So, in order to establish yourself (or re-establish) as girlfriend material, the first thing to do is to immediately stop sleeping with your ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;The risk many women take on in hopes of winning their man back is that of becoming a simple &ldquo;casual girl.&rdquo;&nbsp;However, this tactic has never worked in my experience, as the ex-girlfriend just transitions into another &ldquo;casual girl&rdquo;.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of trying to win him back by offering an ongoing physical connection.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an extremely important point that women sometimes gloss over.&nbsp;Think about it, again, from his perspective:how is he going to value you, other than as a source for sex, if that is all that you provide to him with no reciprocation on his part?&nbsp;While you definitely do want to be more than that, simply continuing physical intimacy is not the way to win back a man&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>If you really wanted to get your boyfriend back, no matter what, you would immediately call him on the phone and tell him that he could have sex with you, whenever he wants, wherever he wants, in whatever manner he wants, with absolutely no strings attached.</p><p>There isn&rsquo;t a man in the world who would reject such a proposition.&nbsp;However, while you would theoretically &ldquo;have him back,&rdquo;it is definitely not in the way you want.&nbsp;You expect commitment in return, and you want to win over his heart – not his penis. </p><p>In short, you want him to respect and admire you. You want him to love you, to think of you all day long, and to desire you.&nbsp;You want him to perpetually pursue you, and you want to be viewed as the prize of the relationship. If, however, he thinks he owns you – he will trample all over you.</p><p>Remember, again. Those who care least, control the power dynamic in a relationship.</p><p>Those words are of utmost importance to remember.&nbsp;The Hollywood version of love involves a happy couple living happily ever after.&nbsp;Unfortunately, such a version does not, and never has, exist in the real world.&nbsp;While love is alive, powerful, and a very tangible and real emotional state, you have to be wary not to let the emotion take over your better judgment. </p><p>A trap that many ex-girlfriends fall into is becoming the &ldquo;casual girl&rdquo;by becoming addicted to the man&rsquo;s validation.&nbsp;They start to do anything to get a little bit more, and slowly, but surely, become totally dependent on his actions towards you.&nbsp;At that point, the man owns you.&nbsp;And he knows it.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page3" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page5" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page5" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page4" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page6" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>The Most Important Thing In A Relationship, Is The Concept Of Value.</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s start off with a simple question:who wants something they already have?&nbsp;Think about this one for a second – if you already have cable TV, an internet connection, and a fully functional mobile phone service, do you really want any more of it?&nbsp;The answer, of course, is no.&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want any more of it because you already have it.&nbsp;So there&rsquo;s no need for any more. </p><p>What does this have to do with male-female relationships? A whole lot more than you might have thought.&nbsp;Imagine if somebody came into your house one day, and stripped away your cable TV, your internet connection, and your new social-networking enabled phone, how would you feel? I know that I would feel like going crazy!&nbsp;Yet, when you were just offered the same services before, you said you didn&rsquo;t want them, because at that point, you already had them.&nbsp;You end up taking such services completely for granted.&nbsp;If, however, you knew in advance that somebody was going to take away your TV, internet, and cell phone, you would take immediate and powerful steps to preventing that!</p><p>So, back to relationships.&nbsp;The key to keeping any, and all, men interested is to never let him believe he has you 100%.&nbsp;The most important thing in a relationship is the concept of Value.&nbsp;If a man, that believes he has won you over completely, he begins to value you less, in short, he beings to take you for granted.</p><p>On the other hand, a woman who is somewhat unpredictable in her affections requires a hell of a lot more effort to keep involved, and the man will make the effort to keep you in his life.&nbsp;The value you offer him is clearly known, but he is never sure if he has a full grasp of it, never sure if you&rsquo;re going to stay or slip away like a stream of smoke.&nbsp;</p><p>This principle can be seen in the way people sometimes get the attention of their cats.&nbsp;If you play with a piece of string, the cat&rsquo;s attention becomes completely fixated on it.&nbsp;You dangle it around, and the cat watched the string, studying its every move.&nbsp;When the time is right, the cat pounces on the string, just to have it pulled away in the nick of time. This can maintain the attention of a cat for countless hours.&nbsp;However, as soon as you put the string down, and the cat sees that, she&rsquo;ll come up to it, maybe paw at it, then turn her back and walk off.</p><p>The same principle applies to relationships, men want what they can&rsquo;t have, and if something comes to them too easily, they find it hard to place value on it, of course, this is at no fault of their own, they are biologically wired to react in such a way!</p><p>You can definitely be loving and caring with your man.&nbsp;However, you can never have your man believe you are metaphorically the string lying on the floor. He will turn his back and shun you.&nbsp;Getting your man back, then, requires you to give him the same feelings you are experiencing now.&nbsp;You want him to feel rejected and pushed away by you.&nbsp;Only this type of psychological trickery will allow you to win him back, but more on that later.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page4" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page6" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page6" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page5" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page7" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>The Myth That MenAare Only Interested In One Thing.</h1><p>This myth is perpetuated and endorsed by the media and Hollywood all the time, and it frustrates me to no end.&nbsp;While there is some truth to it, yes, men are traditionally more interested in the physical aspect of a relationship than women, and it is absolutely NOT the only thing that a man is interested in when in a relationship.&nbsp;In fact, you can strategically work with his physical desires to make him more loyal and more interested in you.&nbsp;Trust me on that.</p><p>In fact, let&rsquo;s go back to our conversation about &ldquo;casual girls&rdquo;and &ldquo;girlfriend material&rdquo;girls.&nbsp;Remember, a man has conflicting desires about the types of women he wants in his life, just as women have and desire different types of men in their life. </p><p>The type of girl who he wants to be his girlfriend triggers more than physical arousal in a man, she triggers feelings of warmth, love, connection, and companionship.&nbsp;This is the type of girl he will stay loyal to, and the type of girl that you must strive to make yourself to be.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve come across multiple studies that show that a significantly larger proportion of men commit suicide,than do women, after experiencing a breakup.&nbsp;This shows that men can and do become deeply emotionally attached to a woman, they just sometimes have trouble showing it.&nbsp;A deep, powerful emotional connection with a man is more difficult to form from the start, but once that connection is made, you become absolutely indispensable to the man.&nbsp;In fact, in the majority of relationships I&rsquo;ve seen, over 90%, the woman has not created that deep emotional bond with her man, and so is at risk of fairly easily losing him. </p><p>This, however, is understandable, as evolutionarily women tend to reserve such strong emotional pillars to extend only to their children.&nbsp;Men, on the other hand, reserve it for the one woman with whom they fall uncontrollably and unconditionally in love.

We benefit from such alignments, and our emotional circuitry is wired to point us in the direction that is most likely to result in such strong bonds.</p><p>Women, however, tend to be afraid that if they demand respect, they will trigger their boyfriend&rsquo;s disinterest and lose their man.&nbsp;Nothing can be further from the truth.&nbsp;A man will recognize the strength taken to form such a conviction, and come to respect the woman even more.&nbsp;However, for some females the threat of losing their boyfriends is literally crippling.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps you have once been, or are now, one of these women.&nbsp;For you, a concept that is of ultimate importance to understand is that of walking power.</p><p>Walking power is the power dynamic that you have to work to control in a relationship. The name is derived from your ability to &ldquo;walk away&rdquo;from the relationship.&nbsp;However, there are women who give their boyfriends the peace of mind of knowing that no matter how poorly they, the boyfriend, behave, the woman will never &ldquo;walk away.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus, there is a distinct lack of walking power in the relationship.&nbsp;If a man believes that no matter how poorly he acts, you will not walk away from the relationship, this knowledge gives him the tools necessary to push your boundaries and test your limits.&nbsp;As you&rsquo;ve learned by now, women without boundaries have minuscule amounts of perceived value.&nbsp;The man you&rsquo;re after will leave you, if you surrender completely to him.</p><p>You may become simply an ex-girlfriend, a casual girl, or a booty call, whatever you want to call it.&nbsp;But I know that that it is not why you bought this book.&nbsp;You want to avoid becoming that girl. </p><p>For this reason, have clear, definable boundaries in your head is of utmost importance.&nbsp;You need to be able to stand your ground, and have the willingness to walk away if those boundaries are crossed.&nbsp;Communicate this to your man.&nbsp;I know from boundless personal experience that he will respect you a lot more once he knows you are a woman who has strong boundaries.</p><p>Moreover, you absolutely cannot afford to show your boyfriend you are afraid of losing him.&nbsp;You must never be at a point, where losing him, becomes synonymous with the end of the world for you.&nbsp;That is not to say, of course, that you can&rsquo;t be loving and affectionate, in fact, I encourage you to let him know that you care about him.&nbsp;</p><p>There isn&rsquo;t a single relationship that can last if your boyfriend thinks that he is meaningless to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he still needs to know that you will be fine and be able to move on if the relationship breaks.&nbsp;This grants you the larger portion of power. </p><p>On beginning a long term relationship, you absolutely need to have an understanding that most relationships end.&nbsp;In all probability, yours will not last &ldquo;till death do you part.&rdquo;&nbsp;While there is a chance that it may, approaching the relationship with the mindset that it is likely to end sooner or later will put you in a stronger position to continue it for a long time. Oh, the irony. </p><p>Now, in your specific case, when your boyfriend broke up with you, you lost your walking power.&nbsp;This shift happened slowly over the course of your relationship.&nbsp;It started when you forgave your boyfriend too easily for a blunder on his part.&nbsp;Little by little, these small blunders grew and spiraled outwards, until you were forgiving him for huge misdeeds.&nbsp;As this happened, he began to realize that he could get away with almost anything he wanted with you.&nbsp;</p>This is a weak point for you to be in.&nbsp;At that juncture, your ex-boyfriend completely had your heart on a string.&nbsp;You were helpless, and while you knew internally that you shouldn&rsquo;t be putting up with his behavior, you did so anyway.&nbsp;This pattern is known as the Downward Spiral of Behavior. </div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page6" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page8" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page8" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page7" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page9" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>The Downward Spiral of Behavior</h1><p>The downward spiraling of behavior occurs when your boyfriend gets away with something that you would not otherwise let anybody else do.&nbsp;At the start of a relationship, we tend to put up with a lot less than later on, once trust and a rapport has been established.</p><p>The boundaries are less clear at the initial point, and so mistakes in behavior by your man can be rationalized, from his perspective, by not fully understanding the rules.&nbsp;This starting moment is a critical time in which to establish your boundaries.&nbsp;Have clearly defined rules for his behavior, and punish him appropriately when he steps over the line.&nbsp;Trust me, having this type of solidity early on, will do wonders in preventing misbehavior at later stages. </p><p>Additionally, avoiding downward spiraling of behavior, is absolutely crucial when defining your boundaries.&nbsp;Once your boyfriend commits a negative behavior, and is allowed to get away with it, it becomes much more difficult to get him out of that downward spiral.&nbsp;As they say, you can&rsquo;t teach an old dog new tricks, and in this case, you can&rsquo;t expect your man to change his behavior six months into a relationship, if he has been doing the same thing since the start.&nbsp;Otherwise, he&rsquo;ll get used to you putting up with his antics, and take advantage of your demeanor. Over time, he&rsquo;ll come to expect that type of passive compliance coming from you. </p><p>If you&rsquo;re not aware of this process beforehand, it can get out of control very quickly.&nbsp;Most women tend to clue in at some point in the relationship, that their boyfriend is getting away with more than they normally tolerate, and think the best strategy is to confront them immediately about it.&nbsp;Unfortunately, this type of tactic is most of the time rendered useless.&nbsp;Your boyfriend will probably laugh it off, and continue with his negative behavior.&nbsp;Once the downward spiral of behavior has started, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to break out of it. </p><p>If you&rsquo;ve experienced this in a relationship, you&rsquo;ve likely even just encountered it in your current relationship, otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t be reading this book! You know how frustrating it can be.&nbsp;Once bad behavior starts, certain patterns develop in the relationship.&nbsp;Your boyfriend likely expected that you were cool with him behaving the way he does, and when you confront him, it seems, from his perspective, that it&rsquo;s coming right out of the blue.&nbsp;This is when the first cracks in a relationship become visible, fighting starts, arguing becomes more common, and the comfort and trust begins to fade.</p><p>To avoid this downward spiral of behavior, you have to be firm in establishing ground rules from the outset of the relationship.&nbsp;If you let your boyfriend get away with behavior you don&rsquo;t like in the opening stages of the relationship, it&rsquo;s dishonest, again, from his perspective, to then decide to, almost arbitrarily, try to stop the behavior once the relationship has moved forward.&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll feel cheated, and, much like a small child, rebel against your warnings, oftentimes only exaggerating the behavior that you confronted him about earlier.&nbsp;So, you have to establish your ground rules at the onset. </p><p>The same principles apply to your own behavior.&nbsp;Say you like going bowling with your girlfriends every Thursday night, or enjoy a Sunday night dancing at the clubs.&nbsp;Make sure to continue doing them in the beginning of a relationship.&nbsp;Your boyfriend will then see them as &ldquo;normal&rdquo;things that you do, and won&rsquo;t ever protest as you keep doing them. However, if all of a sudden, six weeks into dating a guy, you start going out on the weekends to get drinks at the bards, he will immediately become suspicious, Is she cheating on me? He&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;ve lost interest, and in turn be tempted to call the whole thing off, whereas in reality you were only continuing things you&rsquo;ve enjoyed doing before meeting him! You need to set the standard early on, so that no problems are run into concerning your own behavior at later points.&nbsp;With this in place, you can continue to enjoy your own &ldquo;girl time.&rdquo;</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page7" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page9" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page9" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page8" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page10" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>The &quot;Instant shift&rdquo;Technique.</h1><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Allow yourself to feel. Hurt, remorse, anger, longing, sadness, whatever the emotion, feel it—and note WHERE you felt it. For most people, the hurt accumulates in their chest or heart, the heart break. After noting down what you&rsquo;re feeling, and where you&rsquo;re feeling, confront yourself aloud. Yes, aloud. Actually look in the mirror and ask yourself:Can I allow this feeling to overcome me? Is this feeling welcome? Answer these questions as truthfully as you know how.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Ask yourself, can I allow this feeling to go away?</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Will I let this feeling go away?</p><p><strong>Step 4. </strong>When can I let go?</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Assess what you are feeling again.

Your boyfriend did not break up with you due to your appearance.</p><p>In my history, these are the two most commonly cited reasons that women claim their boyfriends broke up with them.&nbsp;While there is a certain elegance and simplicity in being able to point to one thing and say that it spurred the end of a relationship, there is no such clarity in reality.&nbsp;If you, and your boyfriend had a completely stable base of relations, then any one specific thing you did, or said, could not have been enough to undermine what you have built up together over time.&nbsp;The reasons are much, much deeper than that.</p><p>Also, your boyfriend did not break up with you because of your appearance.&nbsp;He was attracted enough to you, as the beautiful, selective, and seductive woman, to pursue you over all his other options, and there are many, just walk into a crowded night club and count the number of single women there.&nbsp;He was attracted enough to you, to sacrifice all of his other potential opportunities to be in a monogamous relationship. So, it&rsquo;s completely nonsensical to imagine that the reason he broke up with you, was due to your appearance.&nbsp;Your appearance was what attracted him to you, not what chased him away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, for the real reasons he broke up with you.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page9" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page11" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page11" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page10" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page12" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>You Gave Him Too Much For Too Little Effort</h1><p>This is the most valuable advice I can bestow upon you.&nbsp;You have to understand that humans, based on deep psychological principles, value that for which they work for.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll say it again. People value things they have to work for.&nbsp;How often has a guy come up to you in a bar, asking to buy you a drink, seemingly completely out of the blue?&nbsp;And how many times have you said yes, knowing full well, that once you&rsquo;ve had the drink, you&rsquo;ll give the guy no more attention?&nbsp;Why do you think that you&rsquo;ve felt absolutely no attraction to the guy, even though he seemingly offered something of value, money, the drink to you?&nbsp;Because you didn&rsquo;t have to work for it!&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been proven time and time again in psychological studies, that people place a significantly higher value on things that they have had to work for!</p><p>Another example. Imagine you are applying to a new, prestigious job position.&nbsp;Your credentials seem to line up perfectly with what the employer is looking for, and your initial interview goes extremely well.&nbsp;The interviewer tells you that you&rsquo;ll receive a call in the next few days to get started with the position. You get excited, telling all your friends that you&rsquo;ve found your newest, high paying job.&nbsp;Except that you don&rsquo;t hear back the next day.&nbsp;Or the next.&nbsp;Or the next.&nbsp;Eventually, a whole week goes by and you haven&rsquo;t heard anything.</p><p>Frustrated, for which you thought it was a perfect match, you call the employer and ask what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp;They string you along, saying that some procedures took longer than expected, and you&rsquo;ll have to come back in for another round of interviews. &nbsp;Reluctantly you agree, wondering why they&rsquo;re making you jump through hoops if they already said that you were exactly who they were looking for! After going through another two weeks of tough, intensive interviews with the management staff, you eventually get the position.</p><p>Now, after going through that grueling, confusing process, how much harder do you think you&rsquo;re going to work to make sure you keep the position? My guess is a hell of a lot harder! Because the employer made you seem dispensable at first, and then made you work extremely hard to get the position, you subconsciously began to question your abilities, and value the position even more!</p><p>The exact same line of reasoning applies to relationships.&nbsp;If you let your boyfriend have you too easily, and without much effort, he&rsquo;ll think that you have low self-esteem and in turn value you less.</p><p>While you thought you were being kind and considerate by only looking at his best characteristics, he was all the while trying to figure out why things came so easily!&nbsp;If he doesn&rsquo;t have to work for making you happy, then his perception of you will be lower.&nbsp;And in turn, he&rsquo;ll be more easily distracted, and attracted, to the new girl coming around.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t blame your man for this type of behavior, as you&rsquo;ve seen, even you are susceptible to valuing things that you worked for more, than things you&rsquo;ve didn&rsquo;t work as hard for.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just human nature.&nbsp;Also, people who give themselves to others too easily, are seen, as we&rsquo;ve said before, as having low self-esteem. And, again, it is a biologically rooted behavior. People with low self-esteem, in turn, are deemed less desirable by the opposite sex.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying here that you need to be selfish, or completely inwardly-oriented. I&rsquo;m just saying, that you need to always be mentally aware of the effort your boyfriend puts in to see you, and make sure that he&rsquo;s always working for you!</p><p>The important thing to take away from this, is the understanding that people value things they have to work for, and, conversely, don&rsquo;t value things that come too easily.&nbsp;Take this newfound knowledge and apply it to your relationships!</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page10" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page12" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page12" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page11" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page13" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>The Monotony Of Relationships</h1><p>A reality common to all relationships is that once a particular point is reached, two people become so comfortable with one another that they stop trying.&nbsp;The spark that attracted them to each other initially has dissipated, and sexual tension is all gone.&nbsp;Both the male and the female take each other for granted.&nbsp;Once this begins, you can kiss goodbye to the magical attraction that you held for each other.</p><p>Such a description seems to be all gloom and doom, no?&nbsp;The good thing is that there is a proven way to avoid this trap.&nbsp;Men and women are constantly comparing one another to other potential partners.&nbsp;When you walked down the street with your boyfriend, notice how he took special attention when looking at other couples, is he more attractive than the man, can he keep you away from the other guy, etc, etc. When your boyfriend begins to assume that you will always be around, he then loses the motivation to fight for you.</p><p>Men and women are biologically driven to compete for the best mate they can find.&nbsp;As a female, by the end of the book, one who is also well-versed in human psychology, the trick to keeping your man loyal and happy in the long run, is to be unpredictable, and have him always thinking, I better work extra hard on my game to keep her!</p><p>This type of thinking is what cements the link between the two of yo,u so that&nbsp;no other woman can come in between your bond.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t think that this type of behavior is unethical or morally wrong in any form, it is just a way to take advantage of your knowledge of human psychology to keep him interested.</p><p>A story I always hear from my male friends typically goes something like this.<br> Joanna was great at the start.&nbsp;She was flirty, laughed at my jokes, and we had a great time together.&nbsp;We had undeniable chemistry.&nbsp;She was touchy-feely and affectionate in public, and I loved it when she dressed up and I got to parade her around on my arm.</p><p>But for some reason, all that slowly started to go away. She began to take less care with her makeup and her clothes when going out, then she slowly became less and less affection, until the magic was just gone.&nbsp;Everything became a tired, boring routine.&nbsp;She started nagging, bitching, and being a horrible time…</p><p>This was actually transcribed from a recorded message a friend left on my machine.&nbsp;He ended up breaking up with Joanna, concluding that they just weren&rsquo;t a good fit anymore.</p><p>How did something like this happen?&nbsp;It&rsquo;s because of the monotony of relationships.&nbsp;Once someone is settled into a comfortable routine, they tend to let themselves go. In turn, the spark that allowed them to get to that point slowly erodes.&nbsp;Men crave validation from you just as much, as you crave validation from them!&nbsp;And once the monotony of relationships takes over, that feeling of newfound validation is gone, because neither of you give it to each other anymore!</p><p>The best thing to do about this, is to work to re-establish your value as a woman. You have to make him deeply believe that you are the same high-value girl he was chasing at the start.&nbsp;Yes, there are specific techniques for doing this, and yes, you will learn them in the later chapters.&nbsp;For now, however, I just want you to consider the woman you were before you started your last relationship, and compare her to the woman you now became.&nbsp;Really take the time to be honest with yourself and think about this.</p><p>Most of my female clients, when asked to do this, realize that they started to act differently. They became less interested in the way they looked, and became more likely to pick fights with their boyfriends.&nbsp;Many of these arguments were even started by completely insignificant things!&nbsp;I&rsquo;m willing to place money on the fact that your relationship suffered greatly from the same, everyday routine that became a critical component of your breakup.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page11" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page13" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page13" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page12" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page14" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>Insecurity And Clinginess</h1><p>The absolute, irrevocable, definite, most conclusive, and best attraction repellent is clinginess and insecurity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Behaviors that are validation seeking, those that you only take part in to gain a compliment from your boyfriend about, are the ultimate form of insecurity.&nbsp;While you obviously crave your man&rsquo;s attention and validation, be sure to never be explicit about it.</p><p>From a male perspective, we tend to view women who are overly needy as little sisters.&nbsp;And who in their right minds could ever be attracted to a little sister?&nbsp;They feel that they need to take on a &ldquo;big brother&rdquo;role to help you, and this is one of the most unattractive positions a man can find himself in.</p><p>Some women tend to cope with the emotional stresses of everyday life by leaning on their boyfriends.&nbsp;While this is fine on occasion, be sure to never find yourself being in a habit of burdening your boyfriend with your emotional luggage.&nbsp;Men don&rsquo;t like that, and often call it quits when a woman does this too much.&nbsp;The reason behind this is that men are typically very bad at understanding emotions, and so get confused and frustrated when they see you expecting them to understand!

A woman who is &ldquo;tough&rdquo;reminds us men of our own gender, and becomes as sexually exciting as a stack of books. </p><p>Women who are tough and rigid also tend to, perhaps unintentionally, emasculate their man.&nbsp;He will secretly resent you for it, and then that resentment will turn to kill any attraction that he has for you.&nbsp;Additionally, if you have completely emasculated your man, he essentially becomes your doormat, subservient and eager to please.&nbsp;From your perspective, this is an unattractive state for him to be in, as it evokes feelings of clinginess and insecurity, which we discussed previously.</p><p>You need to understand that when you try to dominate your man, you inadvertently end up pushing him away.&nbsp;You will turn off any attraction switched on a deep, subconscious level.&nbsp;This directly affects his masculinity and ego.&nbsp;Men have a need to be competitive, vying always to be the &ldquo;best&rdquo;, sometimes under conditions which make no rational sense to women.</p><p>The most attractive type of woman to a man is someone who delicately balances being independent, yet having a softer, vulnerable side that he is able to protect.&nbsp;Even if you are completely independent and refuse to be protected by anyone, you need to pretend to have a vulnerability to evoke your man&rsquo;s natural protection mechanisms.&nbsp;Remember also, a man who protects you is a man who is deeply and emotionally involved with you. </p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page13" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page15" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page15" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page14" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page16" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>The Things That Changed</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the start of the chapter, where we began talking about specific reasons why your relationship failed.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve gone over and discussed, and understood! the four main, and consistent reasons for relationships failing.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve also outlined a strategy in each section, for combatting those very faults.&nbsp;Now, we have to quickly discuss the changes that fostered the four reasons to rear their ugly heads.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> When you think back to the start of your relationship, consider yourself then and compare it to yourself now.&nbsp;What specific things have changed?&nbsp;This is the same exercise as before , feel free to use the same answers.&nbsp;Think back, and consider the specific reasons your ex-boyfriend was drawn to you, and the specific reasons he was pushed away.&nbsp;With an understanding of the four reasons, you&rsquo;ll see how each of the things that changed to push him away, can be attributed to one of the reasons!</p><p>This is a powerful tool for us.&nbsp;While most women might sit and think that she said some specific thing that pushed her man away, or a small fight she had with her ex, the truth is that such small matters rarely add up to contribute to a full-blown breakup.&nbsp;You, however, armed with the understanding of the four key reasons, know that in truth it was the underlying workings of those reasons that contributed to the breakup.</p><p>If you ever think to yourself ,I shouldn&rsquo;t have said this or that , it was what caused him to leave me.&nbsp;STOP! It wasn&rsquo;t that one thing that actually ended the relationship.&nbsp;It was the culmination of all the little things converging in the form of one of the four reasons.</p><p>The power from this understanding comes when you realize that every single breakup, can be traced back to one of the four reasons.&nbsp;And because of this, we have specific methods that we can use to strategically and methodically work, to win back your ex-boyfriends affection, attraction, and – most of all , desire for you.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s get started.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page14" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page16" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page16" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page15" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page17" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>The End of Contact</h1><p>&ldquo;The end of contact.&rdquo;&nbsp;Is that a terrifying string of words?&nbsp;If so, you need to pay extremely close attention to the coming paragraphs. There is no way to say this without shocking you, so I&rsquo;m going to simply say it out loud, do not contact your ex-boyfriend for at least 21 days.&nbsp;This is a rule, that has absolutely no exceptions. The reasons for this are based on deep-rooted psychological mechanisms that operating within your ex-boyfriend&rsquo;s mind, and will be explained shorty.</p><p>There is, however, one caveat to the rule:its fine if your ex-boyfriend gets in touch with you.&nbsp;If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s a glimmer of hope for your relationship,he got in touch with you because he&rsquo;s been thinking ,positively, about you!</p><p>Now, back to the matter at hand, the reasons for ending all contact. There are three main reasons for doing so.</p><p>One. It inhibits you from acting needy.&nbsp;This is of utmost importance, as by doing so, you avoid labeling yourself as &ldquo;insecure.&rdquo;&nbsp;As discussed previously, both neediness and insecurity are universal anti-attraction switches.</p><p>Two. It forces a sense of loss into your boyfriend&rsquo;s emotional circuitry.&nbsp;He will begin to wonder why, you haven&rsquo;t contacted him, and may also begin second-guessing the decision to breakup with you in the first place.&nbsp;If you can get him second-guessing, the battle&rsquo;s already halfway done.&nbsp;Also, people only recognize the value of something once it&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp;Aim to be that value, and to provide that value to your boyfriend.&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll realize how valuable you were and may even inflate his perception of you as you abstain from making contact.</p><p>Three. It gives you more time to read as much of this book as possible, and re-read it until you understand all the material on a very deep, sub-conscious level.</p><p>The mantra behind all of these reasons, if the fact that right after a breakup, you&rsquo;re most vulnerable to communicating insecurity and neediness.&nbsp;This is justly so,&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve lost ,for now, a powerful grounding aspect of your overall life.&nbsp;So, when you&rsquo;re around your ex-boyfriend immediately after breaking up with him, no matter how hard you try, you will invariably communicate signals that demonstrate neediness, and insecurity.</p><p>This is universal, even if you don&rsquo;t verbally say to him that you miss him, you will parlay information either through your body language, tone of voice, intonations, etc etc that you miss your boyfriend.&nbsp;And that gives him the power in the relationship at that point. You want to control as much power as possible in the tender stages right after a breakup, to navigate your man back into your arms for good.</p><p>The remainder of this book will focus on eliminating the qualities in your persona that communicate neediness and securities.&nbsp;This will be done by a combination of both real psychological techniques couples with a few clever tricks and illusions, that make you appear less needy, more confident, and more attractive to your ex-boyfriend.</p><p>Even if you have a feeling of the utmost dread inside, the combination of these techniques will result in you achieving the appearance of utmost calm and security.&nbsp;This reverses the feeling of rejection that your ex-boyfriend is currently making you feel, and shifts the balance of power back to you in the relationship , much as it was back in the early courting period!.<br> Don&rsquo;t Act as a Supporting Lever.</p><p>Many men use their ex-girlfriends for both emotional and physical support after a breakup.&nbsp;This is a natural coping mechanism, and we can tap into this almost-universal rule to use to your advantage.&nbsp;You need to completely reject such advances.&nbsp;Anything that your ex-boyfriend is doing as a way to get over the breakup , that involves you, should be immediately stopped.</p><p>This falls in line with the previous no-contact rule.&nbsp;You do not want to be used by him, to heal himself after the breakup! Additionally, be sure to deprive him of any sex.&nbsp;You shouldn&rsquo;t be giving him any either way until he is fully committed to a real relationship.</p><p>This strategy makes sure that you are not around him after the breakup to ease his pain.&nbsp;You are forcing him to be alone, lonely, and missing you.&nbsp;He is forced to face day-to-day life entirely on his own, which is sometimes enough of a shock to have him run straight back to you.</p><p>Your instincts will tell you otherwise.&nbsp;Make no mistake about it.&nbsp;You will want to be closely in touch in hopes of sparking something between the two of you again.&nbsp;You will want the feel of his body on yours.&nbsp;And you will want to help him when he shows signs of stress.&nbsp;But you have to ensure that you do not cave into these temptations.&nbsp;If you do, you end up helping his healing process ,in turn pushing him further away from you, and hurting your own.&nbsp;He will be, intentionally or not, leeching off you.&nbsp;You do not want to&nbsp;allow yourself to be sucked into this negative world.&nbsp;If you do, you will end up tired, emotionally drained, and boyfriend-less.<br> Once He Contacts YOU</p><p>You&rsquo;ve read the above part and understood the reasons to not initiate contact with your ex.&nbsp;You understand the psychological mechanisms at work behind these suggestions. &nbsp;But, you ask me, what do you do when he contacts you!? and make no mistake about it, he will contact you.&nbsp;</p><p>The way to deal with this is surprisingly simple.&nbsp;First, you have to understand his motivation for contacting you, which comes from two things, he has a sense of loss, and he had begun to value you more.&nbsp;By avoiding contact with him, you&rsquo;ve created, and amplified the sense of loss he feels about you.&nbsp;His natural instincts kick in, and he will want to get in touch with you, to reaffirm his ego.&nbsp;Moreover, he begins to value you more, as you are not simply a girl available on-call and at-demand.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once he gets in touch with you, you can take solace in the fact that things are working exactly according to plan. What you need to do is to act uplifted, happy, and polite.&nbsp;You cannot afford to be rude, depressed, or angry on the phone call.&nbsp;If he comes to visit you somewhere, act cheerful and preoccupied in whatever you were doing before he got there.&nbsp;This allows you to demonstrate high value on your part, it shows that you are getting on with your life, and that he is the one who should be reeling from the loss.&nbsp;You will make him wonder why you&rsquo;re not acting miserable and lonely, and his logic will point to the fact that you must have other things going on in your life, even if you don&rsquo;t, and thus further his feelings of loss.</p><p>When your boyfriend does contact you, the conversation must be as follows.</p><p>First, make small talk with him about any non-emotionally jarring topics.</p><p>Then, let him lead the conversation , he may have gotten in touch to ask you to be his girlfriend again.</p><p>End the conversation first.&nbsp;When on the phone, say that you have your best friend waiting on you at the mall, and you don&rsquo;t want to keep her waiting. Say that he can call you later.&nbsp;Make sure not to come across as upset when ending the conversation.&nbsp;If you see him in person, tell him that you have to get back to the task you were just doing before he showed up.</p><p>Again, it is very important not to be bitter during the conversation.&nbsp;Be cheerful, and demonstrate security in where your life is currently.</p><p>The end of contact rule only comes into effect from your end. Again, if he initiates contact with you, it is a very good sign that he&rsquo;s missing you, and lonely.&nbsp;This gives you a strategic advantage towards getting him back.&nbsp;Under no circumstance should you be the one initiating contact.<br> &nbsp;<br> What not to do in brief:</p><ul> <li>Act depressed.</li> <li>Act sad.</li> <li>Act rude.</li> <li>Treat him poorly.</li> <li>Act disrespectful.</li> <li>Brag about the number of men hitting on you, this will come across as overly showy and in all likelihood he will perceive it as a lie, lowering your value to him.</li> <li>Bring up the breakup in any context.</li> <li>Bring up the relationship in any contact.</li> <li>Ask about his relationships with women since you&rsquo;ve broken up.</li> <li>Ask him about his sex life.</li> <li>Brag about your sex life.</li> <li>Ask him to give the relationship another shot.</li></ul><p>You have to understand that the end of contact is a principle that is highly developed, and has been tested by multiple students of mine.&nbsp;The end of contact, makes your boyfriend realize your value to him.&nbsp;And nobody has ever valued something that&rsquo;s been right beside them the whole time.</p><p>Again, I want to repeat my point about the first conversation that you will have with him, make sure to act cheerful and clear-headed.&nbsp;Be sturdy, and don&rsquo;t act depressed. Period.&nbsp;Let the conversation evolve naturally, but do not bring up anything about the relationship.&nbsp;Let him lead the conversation.&nbsp;If he leads it into discussing your relationship, it&rsquo;s a great sign that he&rsquo;s been thinking about restarting the relationship.&nbsp;As long as you are not the one who brings it up, things are rosy in my book.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe the amazing results that this technique has yielded to women I&rsquo;ve worked with everywhere.&nbsp;All these women did was go on with their lives until their boyfriends called them and begged for another chance.&nbsp;You see, the male mind frequently twists things into a false reality where they believe that they were the cause for the breakup.&nbsp;You want to leverage this fact to you advantage.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page15" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page17" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page17" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page16" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page18" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>Twenty One Days is the Peak Loneliness Period</h1><p>Your boyfriend will experience peak loneliness about three weeks after the breakup. &nbsp;In the first week, he&rsquo;ll feel things like anger and resentment.&nbsp;In the second week, he&rsquo;ll try to get back on his feet and become determined to work on himself, meaningless male bravado.&nbsp;By the third week, when all options have failed, he&rsquo;ll start thinking back to you, and how lonely he is without you.&nbsp;Because of this, he will be the one to contact you first. </p><p>However, in rare occurrences, the ex-boyfriend does not contact his ex-girlfriend.&nbsp;If you have to wait to get in touch with him, don&rsquo;t wait any more than five weeks.&nbsp;After five weeks, he&rsquo;ll really believe that you both have moved on, and it would be almost impossible to get him back.&nbsp;But, if he doesn&rsquo;t get in touch with you within 21 days, you can feel free to be the one to initiate contact.&nbsp;Sometimes you have to wait a bit longer to call, and this can only be judged on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>If the onus falls on you to call, though, there are specific things that you need to do.<br> First, you have to frame him as simply an old friend, who has fallen out of touch.&nbsp;Do not think of him as your former romantic partner.&nbsp;This is so that there is no sign of desperation or neediness on your part.&nbsp;You have to come across as though you are perfectly fine with the breakup.&nbsp;Act as if you were the one who realized that the breakup was best for the two of you, but that it would be a shame to throw away such a phenomenal friendship. </p><p>You know, I wanted to tell you that you were right, that our breakup was best for both of us.&nbsp;But, I feel it would be a shame to throw away our friendship that we&rsquo;ve developed over the last months or years .&nbsp;I&rsquo;d be down to go grab lunch with you to catch up, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve done tons of exciting things since we&rsquo;ve last talked, and so have I.&nbsp;We can work on being friends again, with no hard feelings.</p><p>THAT&rsquo;S the powerful conversation marker you want to use.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s of utmost importance you maintain the vibe of the platonic female friend when you meet with him.&nbsp;However, you will be dressed up to look super sexy when you see him, but careful not to flaunt it.&nbsp;This will remind him of what he lost, and of the value you provide.</p><p>In either case, you mission is to use your friendship with him as a way to sneak stealthily under the radar, and give yourself a confident, less-needy aura.

He is something you cannot have at this moment, and it drives you absolutely crazy. </p><p>When you start to really look deeply at human interactions, and break them down to their very core, you see that there are only two real ways of interacting, either by pulling somebody into us, or pushing them away ,metaphorically of course.&nbsp;To pull somebody in is to show interest about them, conversely, to push somebody away is to demonstrate disinterest.&nbsp;This is particularly powerful when dealing with members of the opposite sex.</p><p>When a man pushes you away, your natural response is to try to pull him in.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a sort of equilibrium that exists, and your subconscious recognizes this.&nbsp;By being pushed away by an attractive man, we are filled with a fear of loss and innately want to extinguish that loss , to pull him in to fill the gap.&nbsp;With your ex-boyfriend, a push can be anything from saying something like ,I need to be alone, to, you&rsquo;re frustrating me, to breaking up with you.&nbsp;All of these actions have the one commonality that they display disinterest and indifference.</p><p><em>&quot;Those Who Care Least Control the Power Dynamic in the Relationship.&quot;</em></p><p>Remember that quote from the start of the book? Good, because this is exactly what&rsquo;s going on in your broken relationship.&nbsp;Right now, you instinctively crave to pull your ex-boyfriend back in, whereas in reality the smart thing to do would be to push him away.&nbsp;Trying to pull him in, simply puts pressure on him and forces him to counteract by pushing you further away. If he&rsquo;s aware of the desperation you&rsquo;re showing, he knows that he can have you whenever he wants.&nbsp;And remember that things that come easily are least desirable.&nbsp;So, trying to pull him in effectively kills the sexual tension between the pair of you.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve already learned a very powerful technique that works on the basis of the push and pull theory of relationships , and you might not even realize it!&nbsp;The technique, of course, is the twenty one day contact break after the breakup.&nbsp;By not initiating contact, your ex will begin to wonder why you&rsquo;ve so easily moved on, and will begin thinking back to all the good memories that you two had together , and gloss over any of the bad.&nbsp;You see, by pushing away, you create a void in his life, and he naturally becomes primed to only remember the good times.&nbsp;And after 3 4 weeks, his loneliness will peak.</p><p>Key to the whole push and pull dynamic is the realization that just as you can pull too much, you can also push too much.&nbsp;Sexual tension arises from a seductive mixture of the two.&nbsp;Men often refer to this as mixed signals, complaining that the women they&rsquo;re seeing are sending them mixed signals.&nbsp;But, this makes the women all the more desirable. </p><p>So, the key to the dynamic is , as with everything, finding the right balance between pulling and pushing. Push your ex away a little bit once in a while, and counteract that by pulling him in a bit more.&nbsp;Pull him in and then push him away. You&rsquo;re trying to get him back, so you really don&rsquo;t need to put much thought into it.&nbsp;Just understand that too much in either direction is bad.&nbsp;You want to show disinterest, then interest, then disinterest again.&nbsp;Rinse, wash, and repeat and have the man of your dreams running back to your arms.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page18" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page20" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page20" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page19" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page21" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>Actionable Steps to Reverse Rejection</h1><p>Of utmost importance is your internal mindset when working from any of the techniques described here.&nbsp;What you need to do is completely cleanse yourself of any insecurities for this to work.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re serious and dedicated to getting your boyfriend back, following the outlined plan is going to be simple.&nbsp;You just have to pay attention, and absorb as much information as you can.&nbsp;Remember, all my techniques are based on deep-rooted human psychological principles, and while they may seem counterintuitive, that&rsquo;s exactly why they work.&nbsp;After all, if something were clearly evident, you would have already done it, no?</p><p>The first step to reverse the deep-seated feeling of rejection is to accept that things have ended.&nbsp;Only once you&rsquo;ve done this can you begin to move on.&nbsp;You have to completely release your ex before you can get him back.&nbsp;Counter-intuitive indeed!&nbsp;Again, remember that a clingy, needy woman repels men. And so, letting go of your ex-boyfriend is the best strategic move in working to getting him back.&nbsp;From your perspective, this works by mitigating any and all approval-seeking behavior.&nbsp;Once you&rsquo;re not seeking approval from him, you become significantly stronger in yourself. </p> <p>So, I&rsquo;ve devised a series of actionable steps you can and will take today to begin the process.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Get a piece of paper out.&nbsp;Right now.&nbsp;Grab a pen, and write down your boyfriend&rsquo;s name on the paper.&nbsp;Follow that up with all of his contact information from memory.&nbsp;Put it away in a spot where you won&rsquo;t be able to see it and return to this book.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Purge every memory of him.&nbsp;Begin by deleting his number from your cell phone.&nbsp;Delete all of his emails.&nbsp;Make sure none are archived or backed up in any way.&nbsp;The only exception to this rule is your Facebook and MySpace accounts. on there, you can leave him on your friend&rsquo;s list but do not look at his profile.&nbsp;Absolutely no exceptions to this.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Put together all the physical items in your home that remind you of your ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;Presents, clothing he bought you, stuffed animals, etc. Get everything together and stuff it into a box.&nbsp;Tape the box shut, and give it away for a friend or family member to hold. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t tell them what&rsquo;s in it explicitly, but tell them that they need to do you the favor of holding it.&nbsp;You want to make sure it&rsquo;s as far away from you as possible.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Next time you masturbate, visualize yourself with other men.&nbsp;Fantasize about other men.&nbsp;You have to have good mental control here, because at no point can you allow your mind to drift back to your ex.&nbsp;Force yourself to think about your ideal man.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s also helpful to visualize what you would do with a million dollars or something that brings the same amount of pleasure.</p><p>Realize that fantasizing about other men will ease the pain of your ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;In a few weeks, the pain you feel will have completely gone away.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Concentrate on all the negative aspects of your ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;Avoid bringing up your selective memory, in which you only remember the good times you&rsquo;ve had and the joys you&rsquo;ve shared.&nbsp;Force yourself to remember the terrible moments.&nbsp;In order to completely withdraw from your boyfriend, you must completely focus on the negative.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page19" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page21" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page21" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page20" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page22" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>Getting YOUR Life Back</h1><p>This is the part where it gets interesting.

However, you have to begin dating other men.&nbsp;Like I said before, you don&rsquo;t need to be excited about it, but you need to do it in order to show to your boyfriend what an attractive woman you still are.&nbsp;You also get rid of any underlying insecurities you might have throughout the process.&nbsp;Once your ex find out, he will instantly double his fear of loss for you, making him seem as less-valuable in your former relationship.&nbsp;He will begin second-guessing himself, which gives you a strong position to be in. </p><p>So, begin to feel out the millions of other men out there.&nbsp;Flirt back to their advances, and reveal the beautiful woman that you are.&nbsp;Although you&rsquo;re very emotional now, you need to start thinking logically and understand that you can move on if you so desire.</p><p>As a fail-safe, if you actually CANNOT get any dates in the next two weeks, it&rsquo;s time to fake it.&nbsp;This is a great place to start, because it doesn&rsquo;t force you into awkward interactions with uninteresting men.&nbsp;When you fake it, you have to make sure he finds out.&nbsp;The next section gives strategies to do so.</p><ul> <li>Create a jealously plot line using your AIM, MSN, Twitter or Facebook accounts.&nbsp;Update your status to something like , going out with Eddy , girls, call me when I get back.&nbsp;Such an update makes it less obvious and obnoxious from the perspective of your boyfriend, and makes it fly under the radar. Take note, however, that he will notice.&nbsp;Just make sure that it&rsquo;s not obvious to him that you&rsquo;re trying to show off , that would be an unmitigated disaster!. You need to carefully allude to the fact that you&rsquo;re moving on with other men in your life and not shove it in his face.&nbsp;He cannot see it as a game you&rsquo;re playing.<br> <br> </li> <li>Hint to his friends.&nbsp;Odds are that you still make contact with some of the people that you know your ex hangs out with.&nbsp;Begin a casual conversation with them by saying something like, you know, since I broke up, we haven&rsquo;t seen each other much, and I miss our friendship. At some point in the conversation, ask them what their plans are for the weekend.&nbsp;When they ask you back, mention something along the lines of , I&rsquo;m going out with this guy Eddy I met last night. You can be sure that your ex&rsquo;s friends will tell him.<br> <br> </li> <li>Online social network games.&nbsp;You know that almost everybody has either a Facebook account, a Twitter account, or a MySpace account.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t ignore this valuable source of jealousy-building.&nbsp;Begin talking to and flirting with other guys in your network.&nbsp;Make sure to do it publicly ,not over private messages, so that your boyfriend can find out.&nbsp;Add lots of smiley faces&nbsp;to your posts, and elongate the vowels in your words to make it sound flirty, You&rsquo;re so funny lots of exclamation points.&nbsp;This will further the jealousy that we&rsquo;re stirring up inside your boyfriend.&nbsp;He is obviously keeping tabs on your profiles, especially since you&rsquo;re not getting in touch with him.&nbsp;He will see the public messages and feel jealous.&nbsp;He was used to having you all to himself, and now that he can&rsquo;t he&rsquo;ll realize what a terrible mistake he made.&nbsp;This again reverses the feeling of rejection.<br> <br> </li> <li>This one is in line with the previous item. You can leverage social networks to your advantage and make a fake male account with whom to interact.&nbsp;Put up a fake picture of a very handsome man , think Antonio Banderas.&nbsp;Make sure the picture doesn&rsquo;t look blatantly fake.&nbsp;Make sure it&rsquo;s a man who is slightly better looking that your ex.&nbsp;Set the profile to private.&nbsp;This makes sure that nobody else can see that it&rsquo;s a fake account , you&rsquo;ll look like a complete moron and loser if your boyfriend accesses the account and sees that it was just created to make him jealous.&nbsp;Once your new fake account is set up, make a few posts on YOUR OWN account from your fake account.&nbsp;Make them flirty and hinting at the things you did, it was great fun last night at bowling, let&rsquo;s do it again.&nbsp;Write the lines to make them look as if you were dating the guy.&nbsp;Make sure that everything remains subtle and you can disguise the way you type. You probably have some tendencies in the way you spell things, or the way you add emoticons to messages, etc. If your ex recognizes the patterns made when you write messages using your fake profile, he&rsquo;ll realize that it&rsquo;s you and everything will completely backfire. The allure of the mystery man must always be up kept.</li></ul><p>These techniques are very useful.&nbsp;Your ex-boyfriend begins to fear he will lose you for good, at which point you&rsquo;ve successfully grounded him.&nbsp;If you did everything correctly and with the right amount of subtlety, he will be overthrown by jealousy.&nbsp;You demonstrate high value on your own part, and develop a feeling of self-confidence as your self-esteem increases.</p><p>Real dates with desirable men are obviously preferred to creating fake profiles.&nbsp;Your confidence will skyrocket, and you will sincerely believe in your own attractiveness.&nbsp;Believing in yourself is something that is very difficult to fake.&nbsp;While it can be done, as with the mystery man profile above, it&rsquo;s obviously better for you to sincerely believe in yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>The buck doesn&rsquo;t stop here.&nbsp;You&rsquo;re a creative woman with a vibrant imagination, and you should be able to come up with a plethora of other methods of activating your ex&rsquo;s jealousy.&nbsp;Just be sure to be subtle about it throughout the whole process.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t make yourself look like a loser by bragging and making it obvious that you&rsquo;re only doing things to make your ex-boyfriend jealous. </p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page21" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page23" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page23" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page22" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page24" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>Start Having Tremendous Fun</h1><p>The next step to getting your boyfriend back is to get back in control with your life.&nbsp;You want to lead a life full of fun and exciting activities, and you want to demonstrate to your ex that you are having tremendous fun.&nbsp;Doing this will make him regret he ever left you.&nbsp;</p><p>Begin by gathering all your friends together and plan an exciting night out.&nbsp;Have drinks with them on a Friday night and hit the bars and clubs after.&nbsp;Feel the thrill of having multiple men hitting on you as soon as you walk into the bar.&nbsp;You already know how good bars and clubs are for building your confidence – every man in there begins to approach you and make you feel valuable.&nbsp;Although you already know this, you may have forgotten the feeling following your breakup.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s essential to feel desirable again as it rids you of the insecure mindset, and demonstrates to your ex-boyfriend that you don&rsquo;t just sit around feeling sorry for yourself.</p><p>Another tip I give is to start hitting the gym.&nbsp;A lot.&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t as a slight to you or your physique – it&rsquo;s just for the simple reason that exercise gets endorphins flowing and reverses the onset of negative emotions.

If you agree, then he&rsquo;ll end up breaking up with you. Or so you think! Remember how many of the advices in this book are counter intuitive, this one fits right up there with the rest. However, the trick lies in maintaining integrity.&nbsp;If your boyfriend believes you&rsquo;re fine with the breakup, he&rsquo;ll begin to question it himself, after all, he was hoping that you would be confrontational about it.&nbsp;Compared to other women, who might react with tears, or begging, or pleading, you&rsquo;ve taken the higher ground and made yourself a wild card.&nbsp;Both traits that help you look valuable and attractive.</p><p>So how do you agree with his decision.&nbsp;First, you have to melt his heart.</p> <p>You know how I feel about you, you&rsquo;re a great guy.&nbsp;You make me smile, and I have great fun with you.&nbsp;I really do.&nbsp;But maybe I&rsquo;m not the right girl for you, and if that&rsquo;s what your gut is telling you, I understand.</p><p>Something like this enables you to avoid looking bitter and hateful.&nbsp;It also shows him you still genuinely care about him, and aren&rsquo;t taking the breakup lightly.&nbsp;You&rsquo;re just a sophisticated woman who understands when the end of a relationship has come , at least that&rsquo;s what you want to look like.&nbsp;Tell him that life goes on, that you both will meet other people that will make you happy, etc. But make sure he knows that you still appreciate him for who he is.</p><p>Also, if he&rsquo;s giving you the talk, make sure to never mention the breakup first.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re the one who suggests the breakup, it&rsquo;s a lot harder for you to try to get back together with him afterwards.&nbsp;When he suggests it, you have the freedom to agree with and respect his decision, but still maintain consistency in getting back together with him later on.&nbsp;In other words, you save face. </p><p>Since he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s going to breakup with you, the burden of making contact will be on him in the first three weeks, especially since you&rsquo;re following the 21 day rule . That&rsquo;s why the script above is so powerful,&nbsp;it allows him to see you as a reasonable, level-headed woman.</p><p>Again, all you&rsquo;re doing is reaffirming to him what a good guy he is, and that you still like him.&nbsp;You&rsquo;re giving him enough respect so that if he&rsquo;s not totally into the relationship he has the freedom to end it without worrying about any prissy behavior from you.&nbsp;This is such a different dynamic than he would normally expect that it tends to just throw him off.&nbsp;If he continues and does breakup with you, there will be no hard feelings, which will make it easier for him to come back to you once he gets lonely.</p><p><strong>If You Agree to The Breakup.</strong></p><p>So the two of you have agreed to the breakup, with you acting the role of the mature, collected partner.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no need to panic, because he will still likely be hesitant about it.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve saved your self-respect, and positioned yourself perfectly to take advantage of the 21-day rule outlined above. &nbsp;He will be confused by your actions ,in a good way.&nbsp;Add some jealousy during the 21-days as outlined before and there&rsquo;s no way he won&rsquo;t come back.</p><p>However, you want some preventable measures to take, don&rsquo;t you.&nbsp;After all, you know that the breakup is a few days away, and you&rsquo;re getting slightly stressed out.&nbsp;The best thing to do is to plan a massive adventure for the two of you.&nbsp;You need to get the adrenaline pumping, and have some excitement going.&nbsp;While not a permanent solution by any stretch, it might be enough to keep your relationship healthy for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;Some things you can do:</p><ul> <li>Go on a last adventure date.</li> <li>Take pictures around the city, have fun, explore things out of bounds, etc.</li> <li>Make your new surroundings fresh and new.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have a chance to re-ignite the flame with your boyfriend by being flirty and fun.</li> <li>Amusement park.&nbsp;Enough said.&nbsp;Amusement parks are a great idea, and the emotions stirred up are always good ones.</li> <li>Rock climbing.</li> <li>Paint ball.</li> <li>Laser tag.</li> <li>Pool.</li> <li>Arcade.</li> <li>Etc, etc.</li></ul><p>You see, the important thing about these activities is that they break the banality of your relationship.&nbsp;You get out of the routine you&rsquo;ve established with your boyfriend and done something new.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t allow your relationship to get stake. favor growth and excitement over predictability and boring-ness. Men don&rsquo;t value what they have until it&rsquo;s too late, but you have to give them every opportunity you can to make them realize the value you provide.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page25" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page27" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page27" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page26" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page28" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>Reward System</h1><p>This chapter is an introduction to the reward system.&nbsp;This is a key component of keeping your boyfriend.&nbsp;Ask yourself, how do most women react when their boyfriend is busy watching sports or out with the guys.&nbsp;They begin to vie for their attention.&nbsp;They give more affection, because they try to win their man back.&nbsp;The hope is that their boyfriend will give them some type of response that makes him snap out of the trance he&rsquo;s in.</p><p>But, there&rsquo;s a dark side to this. &nbsp;How long do you think it will take your boyfriend to realize that ignoring you makes you more likely to give him what he wants? And how long will it take for him to exploit the fact.</p><p>Look, men aren&rsquo;t particularly sophisticated, but we&rsquo;re not stupid either.&nbsp;We realize that when we act badly and our girlfriends react by giving us more attention, all we need to do is to act worse and we&rsquo;ll get even more attention! This is a vicious cycle that you want to avoid at all costs.</p><p>Women do the exact opposite of what they need to do in these situations. If your boyfriend gets angry or upset and you retaliate by giving him more affection ,because you want affection from him, the only thing it will do, is to push him away.&nbsp;<br> So, how to combat this type of cycle. This is where this chapter comes in.</p><p><strong>Rewarding Good Behavior. </strong></p><p>If you start to reward your boyfriend at the right time and after the right behavior, he will become addicted to the rewards and come at your mercy.&nbsp;But you have to align the rewards not with bad behavior , such as ignoring you or going out with his friends, but instead with good behavior that you enjoy.&nbsp;He will subconsciously come to rely on your validation and approval, like a little puppy dog. </p><p>Rewards from you, then, come in the form of validating words and behaviors on your part.&nbsp;Praise, love, and good moods are all rewards you can use to your advantage.&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not giving him physical rewards like gifts;instead, you&rsquo;re rewarding his good behavior by acting friendly, more affectionate, more loving, etc after he does it.<br> Also, if you didn&rsquo;t reward him after he behaves well, how would he know when he&rsquo;s doing a good job or a bad job? It&rsquo;s simple,because men are simple, he wouldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you love it when your man goes down on you.&nbsp;How do you reward that behavior, without reciprocating physically,&nbsp;You tell him using words.&nbsp;Say something like, Hun, you&rsquo;ve got some serious skills down there.&nbsp;Tell me how you&rsquo;re not a porn star again .&nbsp;This will feed his ego and make him more likely to repeat the pleasurable behavior. </p><p>Or, you can be even more sneaky and tell him the good behavior turns you on.&nbsp;The good behavior doesn&rsquo;t even have to be sexual like in the last example for you to tell him that!&nbsp;He might have cooked a dinner for you, and you would tell him how much you love it when a man takes care of the good.&nbsp;Men instinctively then associate such good behaviors with sex, and since they&rsquo;re more fixated on it than women are, he&rsquo;ll start doing a lot more of it.&nbsp;You just have to be very clear and let him know what you like.</p><p>People love receiving praise and appreciation because they get so little of it form the world.&nbsp;Most of humanity consists of insecure, selfish people. They only take approval – they never give any back.&nbsp;So work this to your advantage.&nbsp;Your boyfriend is no exception;praise him after he does something good, and he&rsquo;ll become addicted to your validation.&nbsp;He wants it, he seeks it, and he&rsquo;ll never be able to get enough of it.</p><ul> <li>Some other examples of good behavior include:</li> <li>Being an overall great boyfriend.</li> <li>Buying you things, taking you out.</li> <li>Taking you shopping, being cool when you go out with your girls.</li> <li>Giving you great, long sex.</li> <li>Providing emotional support when you feel bad.</li> <li>Etc.</li></ul><p>All of these come to form the pillars of a strong relationship.&nbsp;Use them to your advantage.</p><p><strong>Real Gifts as Rewards.</strong></p><p>This one is tricky.&nbsp;While you don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in a loop where you have to buy him something every time he does something nice, it is a good idea to once in a while reward him with a real gift , like a hockey stick, or a new car or something.&nbsp;That way, when your boyfriend takes you out on an amazing night on the town, you can give him a little gift afterwards to show your appreciation.&nbsp;He will think of it as a very sentimental item, and attach good emotions to it.&nbsp;Buy him a card and write on it how much you liked the night before, I&rsquo;m sure it will melt his heart.</p><p>However, it&rsquo;s important to make sure he knows exactly&nbsp;the behavior you are rewarding.&nbsp;If he knows what the good behavior is, he&rsquo;ll be likely to repeat it.&nbsp;However, if he only has a vague idea, he&rsquo;ll have no clue of what to do to get your validation again.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re out of money, or recently lost your job, fear not, because gifts that you&rsquo;ve put time into are just as valuable as expensive gift.&nbsp;Make something creative and mix it up a bit.&nbsp;Write him a love letter, with a pink font on black paper.&nbsp;Make it stand out, something that will be a beacon in his memory forever.&nbsp;Just be sure to give it to him after he does something positive.</p><p><strong>Punishing Bad Behavior.</strong></p><p>When your boyfriend behaves badly, you have to punish him, just as you reward him after good behavior.&nbsp;It needs to be done out of love for him and out of respect for your relationship.&nbsp;While it may seem harsh, it&rsquo;s a necessity.</p><p>Be sure to note that punishing bad behavior does not ever have to involve anything like getting angry or physically abusing your boyfriend.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a lot more subtle than that. Things like physical violence come out of insecurity, and is not where you ever want to be.&nbsp;Never use anger as a punishment mechanism.</p><p>So how do you punish his bad behavior.&nbsp;By removing your attention.&nbsp;The degree to which you do this depends on his misdeed coupled with the boundaries that you&rsquo;ve established at the start of your relationship.&nbsp;And his bad behavior typically comes in two forms, a negative mood, and negative actions.</p><p>When your man is in a negative mood, make sure to just ignore him.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t feed into his emotions.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t give him any tinder to make it worse.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t try to piss him off even more as a way of punishing him, that&rsquo;s just the type of engagement he is looking for.&nbsp;Instead, just don&rsquo;t pay him any attention.&nbsp;Stay away, and do something else.&nbsp;Go out with your friends or read a book.&nbsp;Use your attention as a reward, and remove it to punish him.</p><p>Either way, a bad mood should have nothing to do with you.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just how people are wired that makes them sometimes, inexplicably, behave negatively.&nbsp;Anything that he does poorly should be followed up by you removing your attention.&nbsp;Over time, he&rsquo;ll come to realize that when he behaves poorly, he loses your validation.&nbsp;And then he&rsquo;ll start trying hard to act well all the time.</p><p>Again, the key to this is subtlety.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t make it look like you&rsquo;re removing your attention in specific regards to his behavior.&nbsp;Do not pout, or get upset or angry.&nbsp;Simply do something else that allows you to carry on in a happy manner.</p><p>There are also situations in which your boyfriend physically does something unacceptable.&nbsp;Say, for example, he begins being flirty with other women in your presence.&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t just ignore this behavior.&nbsp;Another critical and powerful emotional trigger is disappointment.&nbsp;What this means is that in order to punish him after he behaves poorly is to express disappointment in his actions.</p><p>Take him aside, and without being emotional and negative, just say something like, You know I like you because you don&rsquo;t play silly ames like other men.&nbsp;But lately, you&rsquo;ve been doing just that and I&rsquo;ve come to expect more out of you.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s disappointing to me.&nbsp;He will instantly recognize his mistake and apologize.</p><p>He will also, feeling embarrassed, say that he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything and deny the behavior.&nbsp;Just accept it, don&rsquo;t try to start a fight over it.&nbsp;Give him a small kiss and tell him that you trust him and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p>Think back to when you were a teenager and were caught drinking by your parents.&nbsp;What would you have reacted better to , their expressed disappointment that they trusted you and you broke their trust, or if they got angry and started yelling at you.&nbsp;I think universally the answer is the first one.&nbsp;Make the same principle work with your boyfriend.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page26" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page28" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page28" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page27" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page29" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>The Big Guns</h1><p>Sometimes, simply expressing disappointment and removing attention isn&rsquo;t enough to combat bad behavior.&nbsp;Sometimes, your boyfriend does something so inextricably horrible that you can&rsquo;t stand the sight of him.

Same thing with your relationship.&nbsp;As long as you worked hard for something, no matter how bad that thing is, you will still place significant value on it.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the way relationships work, and that&rsquo;s the way human psychology works.</p><p>So, the more time and effort your boyfriend puts into you, the more he&rsquo;ll come to appreciate you.&nbsp;You can consciously make him invest in you more to make the breakup less likely and make the relationship that much stronger.<br> He has to invest in pleasing you.&nbsp;You have to become a prize all over again, and he will value you a lot more as a human being.&nbsp;Make it so he&rsquo;s worked so hard for you that he can&rsquo;t bear to lose you.</p><p><strong>The Small Things.</strong></p><p>Get him started by asking him to do some small things for you.&nbsp;Ask him to get you a glass of water without being a bitch, and follow it up by saying thank you.&nbsp;Letting your boyfriend take care of you is fine and good. Some girls try to avoid it to remain independent, but that&rsquo;s just a façade.&nbsp;When your boyfriend tries to do something for you, the key is not to reject it by saying, no no baby I&rsquo;ve got it , but the key is to let him do it and then thank him briefly afterwards.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s how you get him to invest in you.&nbsp;He wants to, and you have to let him.&nbsp;Reward him with your approval afterwards.</p><p>Rewarding is very important, as it reaffirms the status of the relationship.&nbsp;Some things that he can do for you include:</p><ul> <li>Give you a hand massage.</li> <li>Buying you things.</li> <li>Writing you a love poem.</li> <li>Singing to you.</li> <li>Washing your car.</li> <li>Washing the dishes.</li> <li>Surprising you with a gift.</li> <li>Taking you out unexpectedly.</li></ul><p>And more. Use your imagination, and whenever he invests in you, reward him.&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll come to fall in love with you for it afterwards. </p><p>However, don&rsquo;t go overboard with this.&nbsp;You need to start small and work your way up, until he is wining and dining you three times a week just to get sex.&nbsp;You become all the more powerful and he starts loving you all the more.</p><p>Central to this whole idea is to start this investment process early in your relationship.&nbsp;Start small, work your way up, and work to establish a pattern of rewarding good behavior and punishing bad behavior.&nbsp;That way, things will be perfect right from the start, and you&rsquo;ll have done yourself a favor by creating a favorable, strong, and impactful relationship with your boyfriend.</p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page28" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page30" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page30" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page29" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page31" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>The Clean Slate Method</h1><p>An apology is a very powerful tool, as much as it is a dangerous one. Used correctly, it can work to your advantage, mend a broken heart, make amends, put the wrong in the right again, and so much more. However, used incorrectly, it can cause severe damage—damage that sometimes cannot be repaired.</p><p>Again, because it has to be stressed, an apology is an extremely powerful tool, too many multi-million dollar lawsuits could have easily been avoided through a simple, genuine apology. Indeed, an apology can sometimes be a miracle worker, one example of such is when a man or woman has an affair on his or her partner and after a heartfelt apology, their partner forgives them. An even more intense example of where apologies work miracles is when families have found it in them to forgive thieves, murderers, rapists, etc through a mere heartfelt apology.</p><p>Now, what do I mean when I say heartfelt.&nbsp;Well, there&rsquo;s more to an apology than saying the words I&rsquo;m sorry, in fact, there&rsquo;s a whole lot more that turns a simple apology into a tool that can be used to start a new clean slate, allowing a relationship to heal and start new.</p><p>If you ask anyone why they&rsquo;re apologizing they&rsquo;ll tell you it&rsquo;s usually to admit that they were wrong. In the dictionary, however, an apology is listed as a defence, justification or excuse, and that&rsquo;s exactly what most of us do when apologizing, we go on the defensive,&nbsp;begin making excuses to justify our behavior and so on. For instance, how many times have you heard someone say, I&rsquo;m sorry, but. </p><p>This type of apology, if we can even call it that, only gets us in deeper trouble. Case of point.</p><p>Jack had to work late for the 5th night in a row. On his way home, because it is the 5th time he&rsquo;s missed diner, he picks up a dozen roses for his wife before making his way home.</p><p>He reaches home, opens the front door and finds Sally clearing off the table,again. He will say something along the lines of I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m late, while he leans in to peck Sally&rsquo;s cheek and offer her the roses he bought.</p><p>Sally will lean away from him, place both hands on her hips and say something along the lines, Sorry isn&rsquo;t going to make things better and neither are those roses. Suddenly, Jacks temper flares at her attitude and he&rsquo;ll yell something in return along the lines of, i did say I was sorry, I don&rsquo;t know what else you want from me. </p> <p>And the rest, as they say, is history. </p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s consider the scenario in a different light, let&rsquo;s say Jack actually made a heartfelt apology, how can he do that.</p><p>Saying sorry and buying your partner gifts doesn&rsquo;t cut it, those tactics may work on preschoolers, but after that it&rsquo;s a lost cause. So let&rsquo;s consider a different approach to a real, heartfelt, apology now. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s replay the scenario above and see how it goes with this added tactic.</p> <p>Jack has been coming home late from work 5 nights in a row because his boss is cutting people off and Jack&rsquo;s worried his job might be next so he&rsquo;s working extra hard to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p><p>He arrives home, late, 5th time in a row, and finds Sally clearing off the table. He&rsquo;ll say something empathetic like, I know you&rsquo;re really frustrated and angry at me coming home late so often.</p><p>Sally will look at Jack and say something along the lines of agreement, I really am frustrated, and a little angry too. Jack will nod his head, accepting what she is saying, I know, and you have every right to be, but people are getting laid off at work and coming come early or on time is just really difficult right now because I&rsquo;m so worried I&rsquo;ll be next.</p><p>Suddenly, the little bit of anger that was in Sally would have melted away by now and she feels it&rsquo;s her turn to comfort, I know there&rsquo;s so much going on at work. Jack will cut her off here, because making excuses for his behavior is not part of the plan, Yeah well that&rsquo;s no excuse. I don&rsquo;t want to keep disappointing you. Tell me what I can do to make it up to you.</p><p>So Sally and Jack sit down at the dining room table and start talking, actually have a discussion where she can comfort him and talk about his stresses and he can comfort her and talk about her stresses, rather than end up having a bitter argument out of miscommunication. </p><p>The most important thing is that Jack never admits he was wrong in being late. He does stress how upset he is for disappointing Sally, and he does take responsibility for the upset in the relationship—but he doesn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s wrong.</p><p>This is the first step of learning how to use the Power of Apology to your benefit, learning how to take responsibility for your actions rather than use the defensive, make excuses justifying myself&nbsp;technique.</p><p>We&rsquo;re going to go deeper into what to say a little later on, but before we get into that I want to tap into bad habits people have when it comes to making an apology. These traits are must avoids, meaning you should avoid them like the plague.</p> <p>Pointing fingers. Stressing who&rsquo;s in the wrong and who&rsquo;s in the right is going to make things worse. Remember what we said about apology—you have to take responsibility of your actions. </p><p>Being insincere. Saying sorry just for the sake of saying sorry because you feel it&rsquo;s what your partner expects is only going to backfire right at you. Same deal with going, I&rsquo;m sorry, but. We learned this above:never make excuses. Take responsibility and give reasons—but never try to justify your actions because it only aggravates your partner more.</p><p>Demanding forgiveness. Some people expect instant forgiveness after making an apology, this is definitely not the case but we&rsquo;ll go more into that a little later.</p> <p>Demanding your partner admit he or she was in the wrong. True enough, using the above method , by taking responsibility of your apology, your partner may admit they were also contributing to the rift in your relationship, but you must not expect them to admit that they were in the wrong, or even expect them to start apologizing to you.</p><p>You need to take responsibility, if your partner had an affair you still need to take responsibility. Your partner may not be taking responsibility, but you can&rsquo;t expect or demand them to take responsibility, unless you no longer want to be part of the relationship, of course, but this is all about salvaging your relationship so we won&rsquo;t get into that.</p><p>Apologizing too soon. When someone should try to make an apology depends on how big the mistake was. If you went out and had one too many beers with your guy pals, a quick apology may be reasonable however, if you went out and had an affair, an instant apology will definitely seem insincere. </p><p>The most important factor in apologizing effectively is having the right mindset. With the right mindset, you&rsquo;ll find that an effective apology will come naturally to you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Acknowledgement.</strong> When starting out your apology, it&rsquo;s important to mention that you understand how the other person feels. A great way to do this is reverse your roles, and let&rsquo;s go back to the Jack and Sally scenario. Imagine Jack spent al afternoon making dinner for Sally who came home late, not once or twice, but FIVE times in a row.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say Jack would be annoyed and angry. Now, in acknowledging their feelings you&rsquo;re letting them know that you know how they feel. However a mere &ldquo;I know how you feel…&rdquo;isn&rsquo;t going to cut it. In fact, it&rsquo;s going to add more salt to the wound. To properly acknowledge their feelings, you should say something along the lines of, I know you feel, angry, lonely, hurt, etc. </p><p>How can someone be angry at you for understanding how they feel? In fact, after pulling them in this way, they may find the tables turned on them and in the end, it&rsquo;s your partner who is comforting YOU.</p><p>How many times have you looked at your partner and said, &ldquo;You look angry…&rdquo;and your partner says something along the lines of, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m BEYOND angry, I&rsquo;m confused, I&rsquo;m upset and I&rsquo;m hurt.&rdquo;Or, sometimes, it goes something along the lines of, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m angry…just a little frustrated with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Either way, you&rsquo;ve won a deeper knowledge of how your partner is feeling.</p><p>The reason WHY. The next most important factor of your apology is your reason. You were late;all your partner can think about is WHY you were late. You had an affair;all your partner can think about is WHY you had the affair. </p><p>The why is critical and can be a very dangerous tool if you&rsquo;re still using the old apology where you go on the defensive and start making excuses to justify your actions. Remember what we talked about up there:taking responsibility. You simply HAVE to take responsibility. How do you do this? You look at the problem and you spend time assessing what caused the problem to happen in the first place. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at another scenario involving Jack and Sally. Sally has gone out and had an affair, and Jack wants to salvage what they have left of their relationship. No, I didn&rsquo;t mistype that—indeed it was Sally who had the affair, but it&rsquo;s Jack who&rsquo;s going to take responsibility for this mistake.</p><p>So going back to what Jack has to do:he has to look at the problem and spend time assessing what caused the problem to happen in the first place—what did he do to contribute to it?</p><p>Jack may say something along the lines of, &ldquo;You were feeling lonely and ignored…&rdquo;.This is step one covered, you&rsquo;ve acknowledged how they feel.</p><p>If Sally didn&rsquo;t cut Jack off already, he will go along to say something along the lines of &ldquo;I was swamped at work, I felt threatened because my boss had laid so many people off and I didn&rsquo;t want to be the next one so instead I overworked myself and kept putting work before you and our family… I wasn&rsquo;t around when you needed me…&rdquo;. Step 2 is covered, you have taken responsibility of the problem.</p><p>At this point, both of them may burst into tears, Sally for finally being given the attention she needed and Jack for feeling the start of a better relationship with Sally on the horizon. Regardless of what happens in step 2, even if Sally threw herself in Jacks arms and everything seemed going as planned, you still have to move onto step 3. </p><p>Step 3 is acknowledging that you were affected by the mistake too—not by what they did, but for what you&rsquo;re taking responsibility over. For instance, Jack could say something along the lines of, &ldquo;I feel really disappointed in myself, hurt and guilty too that it was me who was responsible for your loneliness. But I feel lonely too, because my miscommunication and lack of dedication to our relationship cost me my lover, my best friend, my wife…&rdquo;</p><p>The last step is apologizing. You cannot demand or expect forgiveness, but an apology still has to be made. Your partner may choose to never forgive you, but that&rsquo;s a decision that is totally in their hands. </p><p>The apology is the most powerful step—it&rsquo;s make it or break it here;either the power of apology works for you or doesn&rsquo;t, but never in your apology appear as though you are EXPECTING or DEMANDING forgiveness.</p><p>Jack&rsquo;s apology may go something along the lines of, &ldquo;I realize that I can&rsquo;t turn back the hands of time and do things differently, give you more attention, time, love and respect as much as I want to. I know I can&rsquo;t erase the hurt and loneliness I caused you. And I know that I can&rsquo;t expect forgiveness from you but I still hope you can find it in you to forgive me and give me another chance because I really am sorry…&rdquo;<br> Let&rsquo;s do a quick recap on the steps of this tactic:</p><ol> <li>Acknowledgement of how they feel.</li> <li>The reason—what did you do that contributed to the mistake/problem</li> <li>This experience has affected you too. [IMPORTANT:what you did to contribute to it;never blame it on what THEY did!]</li> <li>A heartfelt apology that neither expects nor demands forgiveness. It also does not go on the defensive or make excuses up to justify the situation. </li></ol><p>This method of apology isn&rsquo;t just limited to your intimate relationship but can be used in ALL your relationships. For instance, let&rsquo;s say you and your friend have conflicting political views and are having a really heated argument. You can stop, acknowledge how they feel, take responsibility of the argument, make a reason and apologize. </p><p>And remember, you don&rsquo;t have to use this method in the big issues only either. If you have small outings on a regular basis, you can also use the Power of Apology to make sure they are not being piled up against each other and possibly used against you later on. </p></div><!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page29" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page31" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end--> </div></div><!-- Page End --> <!-- Page Start --><div style="height:100%" data-role="page" id="page31" data-theme="c"> <div style="background-color:#dedede" data-role="content"> <!-- Nav bar --> <div align="center" data-type="horizontal" data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#page" data-role="button">Home</a><a href="#page30" data-role="button">Back</a><a href="#page32" data-role="button"data-iconpos="right">Next</a></div><!-- Nav bar end --><div style="padding-top:0px;border:1px solid #999" data-role="content" data-theme="d"><h1>Looking Critically at Your Relationship</h1><p>Congratulations, you&rsquo;re almost done the book!
